## Iterative Sorts

### Bubble Sort

- Stable
- Destructive
- Best Complexity: O(n)
- Average Complexity: O(n^2)
- Worst Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Insertion Sort

- Better than Bubble Sorted
- Mostly sorted list are best
- Stable
- Destructive
- Best Complexity: O(n)
- Average Complexity: O(n^2)
- Worst Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Recursive Sorts

https://www.scheme.org/

### Recursion

- base condition
- sometime iterative is faster than recusrive

### Nested Addition

### Factorial

### Merge Sort

<!-- - Stable -->
<!-- - Destructive -->

- Best Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Average Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Worst Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
