## Iterative Sorts

### Bubble Sort

- Stable
- Destructive
- Best Complexity: O(n)
- Average Complexity: O(n^2)
- Worst Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Insertion Sort

- Better than Bubble Sorted
- Mostly sorted list are best
- Stable
- Destructive
- Best Complexity: O(n)
- Average Complexity: O(n^2)
- Worst Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Recursive Sorts

https://www.scheme.org/

### Recursion

- base condition
- sometime iterative is faster than recusrive

### Nested Addition

### Factorial

### Merge Sort

<!-- - Stable -->
<!-- - Destructive -->

- Divide and Conquer
- Best Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Average Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Worst Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

### Quick Sort

- Non Stable
- Divide and Conquer
- Non-Destructive / Destructive
- Best Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Average Complexity: O(n^2)
- Worst Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(logn) Destructive
- Space Complexity: O(n) Non Destructive
- Variations: quicksort3

## Non-Comparison Sort

### Radix Sort

- use method called bucketing
- Big O: O(n \_ k)
- Space Complexity: O(n + k)

## Binary Search

- works on sorted array
- Big O: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Lists

### ArrayList

- replace and lookup: O(1)
- deletion, insertion: O(n)
